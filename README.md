## Introduction
Ghibli Travel is a Studio Ghibli inspired whimsical travel application. This application offers a traveler view and an agent view. After logging in with a traveler username you will be taken to the traveler view where you can see all past, upcoming and pending trips. A chart will show how much you have spent on each trip you've taken and you with have a total amount spent this year and total also displayed. You also have the functionality to book a new trip. Before fully confirming you'll get a price estimate as well. In the agent view, you will see cards on display of all trips currently pending with the ability to either approve them or delete them. You will also see the amount of people traveling today and how much money has been made overall and just this year.
